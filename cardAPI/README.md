# WhiteBird Card API Guide

## Purpose
Requests for partners to retrieve the list of a client's available payment methods, as well as the ability to add new payment methods.

### Description
To perform operations, a partner can act as a [paymentProvider](../paymentProviderAPI). This is a deep integration of payment methods in order to avoid PSP fees.

A partner can also use the existing payment systems that are already integrated with WhiteBird. In this case, the user adds payment cards in the partner's application via the API described below.

Requests are authorized via the **x-api-key** header. All requests are Backend-to-Backend.

### Sections:
- **[Get list of available providers](#providers-request)**
- **[Add a card](#card-bind-request)**
- **[Get list of cards](#payment-methods-request)**
